## Emotional Intelligence

### An Intro

Perhaps one of the early concepts in the book is that of "emotional hijacking". Your [amygdalae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala) are two small areas on the bottom of your brain that have a key role in emotion, memory, and sense processing. They can access and process some sensory information long before the emtion-regulating neocortex can. Also, these areas of the brain develop faster than the neocortex, potentially linking negative or positive emotions with stimuli during childhood that make no rational sense. So, a powerful and possibly irrational cluster of neurons gets the first pass at incoming stimuli before the conscious mind can reason about it. If it decides a stimulus is threatening, it can overwhelm the rest of the brain in what is called [amygdala hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack). (Are all the sources on that wikipedia page just taking the info from the book?...)

Next, we dive into the ideas of multiple intelligences 
put forth by [Howard Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Gardner). An IQ or typical college entry standardized test just measures a few dimensions of intelligence, mostly those concerning logic, short-term memory, and other strictly cognitive skills. However, soft skills like self-motivation and working well with others have enormous impact on life's trajectory. A person in good command of emotions can more skillfully harness their cognitive abilities. So, Gardner has a school in which he tries to approach education with this broader perspective, using a model of success that is not just a college professor.

So what are the traits that make up emotional intelligence? Can it be measured like IQ? The book identifies these core skills that are explored in later chapters.

* identifying one's own emotions
* managing one's own emotion
* self-motivation
* identifying other's emotions
* managing relaionships

As for the measurement, the book does not say much.

### Identifyng One's Own Emotion

Navigating life well requires us to maintain some gauge on our own internal mental states. There are a few levels of this kind of metacognition. On one end, we can be fully engulfed in the moment's intense emotions. On the other, self-awareness and control. Presumably the neocortex is involved in the ability to become aware of our own feelings. [Alexithymia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia) is a condition in which an individual has difficulting expressing and describing emotion, either self emotion or others. Emotions may still happen, but the cause is not clear.

Emotions also form a foundational part of our decision making process, even when we act rationally. This is because many of our simple daily decisions - what to eat for lunch, what kind of dog to get, which clothes to wear - are ultimately all logically equivalent, but our emotions weight options with values and preferences, making choices possible. For a particularly dramatic example, read about [Elliot](https://www.thecut.com/2016/06/how-only-using-logic-destroyed-a-man.html), whose life unravelled after a brain tumor was removed. On the surface, he seemed perfectly able and intelligent. But he was completely unable to plan without becoming flooded with essentially identical possibilities.

### Managing One's Own Emotion

After recognizing you are having some kind of emotion, what do you do? Each has its own helpful strategies, but the two main techniques seem to be challenging or reframing the roots of the emotion and distracting ourselves from it.

#### Anger

Anger is difficult to control because it "feels good" to immerse yourself in the monologue that feeds it. Biologically, anger is accompanied by a release of [catecholamates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine) directed by the brain. These chemicals can remain active some time after you feel you've recovered from the anger, which lowers the threshold for future anger to occur. 

So if "cooling off" is your anger management strategy, give it extra time. Another good tactic is to imagine why the other party has acted in whatever way angered you. The perspective shift away from the self can help break the cycle. A strategy that doesn't work is "venting" by feeding the anger. It feels good, but can often leave you just as angry.

#### Worry

Worrying is useful for anticipating and planning for future harms, but when no solution to the cause of worry can be found, the mind can get locked in a destructive loop. Distractions can help, as can challenging the worrying thoughts. Having a rehearsed relaxation technique that you've mastered outside of worrying spells also helps. Of course, these all require you to have the self-awareness to catch the worrying.

#### Sadness

Some sadness is healthy, especially after something sad has happened. It gives us space to reflect on the lost person or thing and build a narrative that allows healing. Prolonged or unexplained sadness, however, is problematic. Like both anger and worry, it can often seem right to immerse ourselves in the sadness, thinking that exploring it fully will help us get rid of it, but that's often not the case. Distraction and challenging are more effective.

Distractions should be something upbeat if possible, to avoid feeding the melancholy. Reading, exercising, watching TV, or playing video games are helpful. Just be sure that the distraction won't leave you more depressed, like eating, shopping, or social media surfing might.

#### Motivation

Top performers in any activity must find the correct mindset to practice for hours a day and stay positive, upbeat, and focused. This ability to delay gratification can be measured in children with the "[marshmallow test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment)", in which children must ensure the temptation of one marshmallow for the reward of a second marshmallow. Being able to pull off this feat is correlated with many measurements of "success", like high SAT scores, low BMI, etc., many years later.

Anxiety and motivation have an interesting relationship. No anxiety at all might make you feel overconfident about you abilities, and so you'll not put in work. Too much anxiety, on the other hand, constricts thought and saps the mind of resources better allocated to the task at hand.

Hope and optimism are other emotions that accompany motivation for success. People who are not burdened with doubts or view failures as external, changeable obstacles usually excel over those who believe that failures originate from fixed character flaws. The good news is that hope and optimism can actually be learned!

Finally, the notion of [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) ties in with motivation. In flow, a person is hyperfocused at a task which challenges them and they have mastery. The experience is emotionally rewarding, and so finding ways for students to match up skill with difficulty to encourage the flow state can improve motivation to learn and practice. Erring on this balance can lead to boredom on one hand or stress on the other.

### Empathy

Our ability to read others' emotions begins while we are still babies. Young children exhibit [motor mimicry](http://web.uvic.ca/psyc/bavelas/Motor_mimicry.html), for instance. Also, infants look to parents for emotional guidance  and validation in a process called *attunement*. Misattuned children have trouble socializing, as some key neural structures are built up in this attunement process.

Studies in other animals' brains finds specialized areas for decoding emotion-laden gestures and other primates have been observed comforting each other, so the skill of understanding other's feelings is not unique to humans.
