## Emotional Intelligence

### An Intro

Perhaps one of the early concepts in the book is that of "emotional hijacking". Your [amygdalae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala) are two small areas on the bottom of your brain that have a key role in emotion, memory, and sense processing. They can access and process some sensory information long before the emtion-regulating neocortex can. Also, these areas of the brain develop faster than the neocortex, potentially linking negative or positive emotions with stimuli during childhood that make no rational sense. So, a powerful and possibly irrational cluster of neurons gets the first pass at incoming stimuli before the conscious mind can reason about it. If it decides a stimulus is threatening, it can overwhelm the rest of the brain in what is called [amygdala hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack). (Are all the sources on that wikipedia page just taking the info from the book?...)

Next, we dive into the ideas of multiple intelligences 
put forth by [Howard Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Gardner). An IQ or typical college entry standardized test just measures a few dimensions of intelligence, mostly those concerning logic, short-term memory, and other strictly cognitive skills. However, soft skills like self-motivation and working well with others have enormous impact on life's trajectory. A person in good command of emotions can more skillfully harness their cognitive abilities. So, Gardner has a school in which he tries to approach education with this broader perspective, using a model of success that is not just a college professor.

So what are the traits that make up emotional intelligence? Can it be measured like IQ? The book identifies these core skills that are explored in later chapters.

* identifying one's own emotions
* managing one's own emotion
* self-motivation
* identifying other's emotions
* managing relaionships

As for the measurement, the book does not say much.

### Identifyng One's Own Emotion

Navigating life well requires us to maintain some gauge on our own internal mental states. There are a few levels of this kind of metacognition. On one end, we can be fully engulfed in the moment's intense emotions. On the other, self-awareness and control. Presumably the neocortex is involved in the ability to become aware of our own feelings. [Alexithymia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia) is a condition in which an individual has difficulting expressing and describing emotion, either self emotion or others. Emotions may still happen, but the cause is not clear.
