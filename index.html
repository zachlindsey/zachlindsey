<h1>Hi, I'm Zach!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the place I leave notes to my future self and share what I'm doing with the world. You'll find some notes on data science, random thoughts on books, and whatever else I feel like sharing.</p>

<p>This page is under some pretty heavy construction, so don't be surprised if some odd things happen. :)</p>
