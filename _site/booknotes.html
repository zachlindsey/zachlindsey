	<h2> Emotional Intelligence </h2>

	Perhaps one of the early concepts in the book is that of "emotional hijacking". Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala">amygdalae</a> are two small organs under your brain that have a key role in emotion, memory, and sense processing. They can access and process some sensory information long before the emtion-regulating neocortex can. Also, these areas of the brain develop faster than the neocortex, potentially linking negative or positive emotions with stimuli during childhood that make no rational sense. So, a powerful and possibly irrational cluster of neurons gets the first pass at incoming stimuli before the conscious mind can reason about it. If it decides a stimulus is threatening, it can overwhelm the rest of the brain in what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack">amygdala hijacking</a>. (Are all the sources on that wikipedia page just taking the info from the book?...)
