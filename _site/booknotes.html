<p>Just a place to record thoughts on books…</p>

<h2 id="emotional-intelligence">Emotional Intelligence</h2>

<h3 id="an-intro">An Intro</h3>

<p>Perhaps one of the early concepts in the book is that of “emotional hijacking”. Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala">amygdalae</a> are two small areas on the bottom of your brain that have a key role in emotion, memory, and sense processing. They can access and process some sensory information long before the emtion-regulating neocortex can. Also, these areas of the brain develop faster than the neocortex, potentially linking negative or positive emotions with stimuli during childhood that make no rational sense. So, a powerful and possibly irrational cluster of neurons gets the first pass at incoming stimuli before the conscious mind can reason about it. If it decides a stimulus is threatening, it can overwhelm the rest of the brain in what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack">amygdala hijacking</a>. (Are all the sources on that wikipedia page just taking the info from the book?…)</p>

<p>Next, we dive into the ideas of multiple intelligences 
put forth by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Gardner">Howard Gardner</a>. An IQ or typical college entry standardized test just measures a few dimensions of intelligence, mostly those concerning logic, short-term memory, and other strictly cognitive skills. However, soft skills like self-motivation and working well with others have enormous impact on life’s trajectory. A person in good command of emotions can more skillfully harness their cognitive abilities. So, Gardner has a school in which he tries to approach education with this broader perspective, using a model of success that is not just a college professor.</p>

<p>So what are the traits that make up emotional intelligence? Can it be measured like IQ? The book identifies these core skills that are explored in later chapters.</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying one’s own emotions</li>
  <li>managing one’s own emotion</li>
  <li>self-motivation</li>
  <li>identifying other’s emotions</li>
  <li>managing relaionships</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the measurement, the book does not say much.</p>

<h3 id="identifyng-ones-own-emotion">Identifyng One’s Own Emotion</h3>

<p>Navigating life well requires us to maintain some gauge on our own internal mental states. There are a few levels of this kind of metacognition. On one end, we can be fully engulfed in the moment’s intense emotions. On the other, self-awareness and control. Presumably the neocortex is involved in the ability to become aware of our own feelings. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia">Alexithymia</a> is a condition in which an individual has difficulting expressing and describing emotion, either self emotion or others. Emotions may still happen, but the cause is not clear.</p>

<p>Emotions also form a foundational part of our decision making process, even when we act rationally. This is because many of our simple daily decisions - what to eat for lunch, what kind of dog to get, which clothes to wear - are ultimately all logically equivalent, but our emotions weight options with values and preferences, making choices possible. For a particularly dramatic example, read about <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/06/how-only-using-logic-destroyed-a-man.html">Elliot</a>, whose life unravelled after a brain tumor was removed. On the surface, he seemed perfectly able and intelligent. But he was completely unable to plan without becoming flooded with essentially identical possibilities.</p>

<h3 id="managing-ones-own-emotion">Managing One’s Own Emotion</h3>

<p>After recognizing you are having some kind of emotion, what do you do? Each has its own helpful strategies, but the two main techniques seem to be challenging or reframing the roots of the emotion and distracting ourselves from it.</p>

<h4 id="anger">Anger</h4>

<p>Anger is difficult to control because it “feels good” to immerse yourself in the monologue that feeds it. Biologically, anger is accompanied by a release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catecholamine">catecholamates</a> directed by the brain. These chemicals can remain active some time after you feel you’ve recovered from the anger, which lowers the threshold for future anger to occur.</p>

<p>So if “cooling off” is your anger management strategy, give it extra time. Another good tactic is to imagine why the other party has acted in whatever way angered you. The perspective shift away from the self can help break the cycle. A strategy that doesn’t work is “venting” by feeding the anger. It feels good, but can often leave you just as angry.</p>

<h4 id="worry">Worry</h4>

<p>Worrying is useful for anticipating and planning for future harms, but when no solution to the cause of worry can be found, the mind can get locked in a destructive loop. Distractions can help, as can challenging the worrying thoughts. Having a rehearsed relaxation technique that you’ve mastered outside of worrying spells also helps. Of course, these all require you to have the self-awareness to catch the worrying.</p>

<h4 id="sadness">Sadness</h4>

<p>Some sadness is healthy, especially after something sad has happened. It gives us space to reflect on the lost person or thing and build a narrative that allows healing. Prolonged or unexplained sadness, however, is problematic. Like both anger and worry, it can often seem right to immerse ourselves in the sadness, thinking that exploring it fully will help us get rid of it, but that’s often not the case. Distraction and challenging are more effective.</p>

<p>Distractions should be something upbeat if possible, to avoid feeding the melancholy. Reading, exercising, watching TV, or playing video games are helpful. Just be sure that the distraction won’t leave you more depressed, like eating, shopping, or social media surfing might.</p>

<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>

<p>Top performers in any activity must find the correct mindset to practice for hours a day and stay positive, upbeat, and focused. This ability to delay gratification can be measured in children with the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment">marshmallow test</a>”, in which children must ensure the temptation of one marshmallow for the reward of a second marshmallow. Being able to pull off this feat is correlated with many measurements of “success”, like high SAT scores, low BMI, etc., many years later.</p>

<p>Anxiety and motivation have an interesting relationship. No anxiety at all might make you feel overconfident about you abilities, and so you’ll not put in work. Too much anxiety, on the other hand, constricts thought and saps the mind of resources better allocated to the task at hand.</p>

<p>Hope and optimism are other emotions that accompany motivation for success. People who are not burdened with doubts or view failures as external, changeable obstacles usually excel over those who believe that failures originate from fixed character flaws. The good news is that hope and optimism can actually be learned!</p>

<p>Finally, the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> ties in with motivation. In flow, a person is hyperfocused at a task which challenges them and they have mastery. The experience is emotionally rewarding, and so finding ways for students to match up skill with difficulty to encourage the flow state can improve motivation to learn and practice. Erring on this balance can lead to boredom on one hand or stress on the other.</p>

<h3 id="empathy">Empathy</h3>

<p>Our ability to read others’ emotions begins while we are still babies. Young children exhibit <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/psyc/bavelas/Motor_mimicry.html">motor mimicry</a>, for instance. Also, infants look to parents for emotional guidance  and validation in a process called <em>attunement</em>. Misattuned children have trouble socializing, as some key neural structures are built up in this attunement process.</p>

<p>Studies in other animals’ brains finds specialized areas for decoding emotion-laden gestures and other primates have been observed comforting each other, so the skill of understanding other’s feelings is not unique to humans.</p>

<p>Empathy might be at the root of justice, as evidenced by how those with high scores on empathy tests also sjow more willingness to intervene to prevent harm to others. Conversely, people with a lack of empathy, either misunderstanding or totally unresponsive to other’s pain, can commit heinous acts.</p>

<h3 id="spreading-and-manipulating-emotion">Spreading and Manipulating Emotion</h3>

<p>Social success rests on the ability to not only understand other’s emotions, but respond to them correctly and broadcast appropriate emotional signals. Each cultural setting has some set of <em>display rules</em> that dictates how emotions must be suppressed, exaggerated, or substituted. The signals are often nonverbal, and picking up on them at a young age is essential. Children with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyssemia">dyssemia</a>, a deficiency of nonverbal communication skills, can have tremendous difficulty getting along with peers and even adults, weighing down social and academic progress. On the other extreme, a person <em>too</em> suscpetible to other’s emotions, merely blending in with the other at the expense of staying true to the self, can wind up with shallow relationships.</p>

<p>The book lists four different facets of interpersonal intelligence, all of which use verbal and nonverbal communication.</p>
<ol>
  <li>organizing groups</li>
  <li>mediating disputes</li>
  <li>personal connection</li>
  <li>social analysis</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="managing-relationships">Managing Relationships</h3>

<p>This chapter is about marriage, but I find some of the statements about it problematic, since the advice basically applies to any relationship! I will pass on one observation: very young children have roughly equal proportions of boys and girls in friend groups. However, this changes, and the two groups separate into distinct social groups. They are also treated differently, encouraged to play different games, and allowed to display emotions differently. Probably lots of gender identity is planted during these years.</p>

<p>Anyway, the relationship tips are basically the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>When delivering critism, avoid personal attacks or absolutes about the person. Focus on the action, how it makes you feel, and how to correct it.</li>
  <li>Emotions like contempt are corrosive to healthly relationships, and must not fester or be signalled.</li>
  <li>When taking critism, avoid becoming defensive. Fight the urge to view the criticism as an attack you must win, and frame it as a way to work together for improvement.</li>
  <li>Tone down negative “emotional background thoughts”, which are those negative statements you make to yourself. This not only goes with thoughts about others, but self-deprecating thoughts, too. They lower the threshold for stronger, negative emotion, and they can be inadventently broadcast to others.</li>
  <li>Practice listening, calm, and empathy when having discussions. Keep both your feelings and the other’s in mind.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="relationships-in-the-workplace">Relationships in the Workplace</h3>

<p>Most of the tips from the above carry over to the workplace. Some special emphasis is placed on delivering feedback and criticism, since overly harsh or insensitive delivery can destroy motivation and performance. When giving feedback, it’s best to focus on the performance, not the person. Offer ways to improve instead of just declaring the work is unsatisfactory and be sensitive in delivey. On the other end, keep in mind that feedback is a way to improve together, not a personal attack.</p>

<p>Being emotionally competent is especially necessary as we move into the “knoweldge economy”. A study in Bell labs found that the superstars were not necessarily the most brilliant individuals, but rather those who had strong social networks. When a problem arose, these people had networks they could tap into to get the information and technical expertise they lacked. Some of the different types of social networks include communcation, technical, and trust. Strong connection in all three is the key.</p>

<p>The book also talks a little about how thoughts on diversity in the workplace began its shifting in the 90s. One of the best things you can do is speak up against discrimination. Toleration is endorsement. Many aren’t explicitly biased, but we find “unbaised” ways to rationalize our subconscious prejudices, and if these are not called out, they will fester.</p>

<h3 id="emotions-and-health">Emotions and Health</h3>

<p>The book pushes the notion that emotions are medically relevant and a sterile, businesslike approach to medicine is not ideal. There is a vast chasm between treating disease, the physical malfunctioning of the body or mind, and illness, the lifestyle and hardships that come with coping with the disease. Helping the former can improve the latter, as it turns out. This makes some sense when you recall there is a tight interlocking between the central nervous system and various regulatory hormones throughout the body. For instance, surgeons know that patients under tremendous stress about their operation fare far worse in recovery. Constant anger is linked with heart disease.</p>
